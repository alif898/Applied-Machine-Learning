# Applied Machine Learning 

Code used for Applied Machine Learning course, feautring custom implementations of ML models.
The custom models were built mainly using NumPy for its matrix/vector operations, adhering to OOP concepts, utilising abstract classes and inheritance where appropriate and benchmarked against existing implementations provided by common machine learning libraries.

Models were used in 3 different projects:

 1. KNN & DT on Hepatitis & Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen datasets
 2. Logistic & Multiclass Regression on IMDB Reviews & 20 Newsgroup datasets
 3. MLP on Fashion-MNIST dataset
